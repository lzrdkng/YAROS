@deftypevr {Global} @typ{jiffy_t} jiffies

it come to counting time, and this limit is call a jiffy.  We define a
jiffy to be the smallest unit of time for the system.  The variable
@code{jiffies} hold the amount of jiffies ellapsed since the system
had started.  This variable is increment @code{HZ} times per second,
